# C++ Server for Network Connections and Shortest Path Calculations

This C++ project implements a server capable of managing network connections and performing shortest path calculations on a graph. The project combines networking and algorithmic logic to deliver a robust solution for applications requiring dynamic routing and efficient communication.

## Key Features

### Networking
- Developed a server to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- Implemented reliable data transmission using TCP sockets.
- Included error handling and optimized connection management.

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- Implemented algorithms like Dijkstra to find the shortest path between graph nodes.
- Supported dynamic graph updates and re-computation of shortest paths in real-time.

### Modular Design
- Clear separation between networking logic and graph algorithm implementations.
- Utilized modern C++ practices for performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **C++** (Standard Library, Socket Programming)
- **Graph data structures and algorithms**
- **Multithreading** for handling concurrent client requests
